        </h1>
        <p>Radical Omnist Party serves to create a world where both extremes of every single political axis, even if the axis is seemingly a joke made on Reddit, is followed to the fullest. This would make all the extremists happy because their ideology is included, as well as pleasing the moderates who, after all, believe that both sides have a point.</p>
        <p>Most world problems are created by the fact that people simply can’t agree on how to run the world. For example, people believe anarchism and totalitarianism can't possibly work together, but anarchism or totalitarianism alone would not please everyone. Some may argue that the best solution would be a compromise, but a compromise would do nothing but serve the moderates. A compromise would throw the extremists under the bus, and that goes fundamentally against our main goal: <strong>everyone should be included, <u>especially</u> the extremists</strong>. To please everyone, we wish to combine both anarchism and totalitarianism. Similarly, we wish to combine each extreme of every single political axis to reach the maximum political happiness</p>
        <p>However, some people don’t want to be included, and we respect that. Our mission to include everyone is inherently exclusive, as while you are included as much as possible, you are also excluded as much as possible. This makes us the most inclusive and exclusive political party, and being <i>the most</i> of something, or in our case, everything, is pretty radical. Because of that, we are the Radical Omnist Party.</p>
