            <h3>What does the platypus mean? </h3>
            <p>We chose to use a platypus as a symbol because it's like a combination of every animal. It's a mammal, but has a beak and lays eggs like a bird. It is venomous like a snake. Moreover, it also spends a lot of time in water, and could easily be considered a fish. Because of this, platypuses are omnist. That's a perfect symbol of us in ROMP.</p>

            <h3>Wouldn't ROMP being in the government go against what you believe in?</h3>
            <p>ROMP's main goal is not to stay in the government. We want to infiltrate the government, make sure to get the world in the right direction, create the AI needed for the new government, and remove ourselves. We are willing to take one for the team and disappear (to avoid being on top of any hierarchy) after our duty of creating a radical omnist society is fulfilled.</p>
